        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>No-bake blueberry cheesecake is an irresistible treat for all occasions. Its soft and creamy filling has an incredibly intense blueberry flavor. Due to the combination of homemade blueberry sauce, cream cheese, and whipped cream, it's a light filling that perfectly matches the graham cracker crust.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blueberry Sauce</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
                    <li>2 cups blueberries, fresh or thawed</li>
                    <li>⅓ cup granulated white sugar</li>
                    <li>½ cup water</li>
                    <li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Crust</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups (7oz) graham cracker crumbs or 36 pcs. Oreo cookies</li>
                    <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Filling</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream (36% - 39% fat content)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>3 cups cream cheese, softened</li>
                    <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cornstarch and 2 tablespoon (30ml) water and stir until the cornstarch is dissolved. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan, bring the blueberries, sugar, ½ cup (120ml) water, and lemon juice over medium-high heat to a simmer. Cook for about 5 minutes until the blueberries break apart, and the sauce stops foaming. Stir constantly. Then stir in the cornstarch mixture and bring the sauce to a boil. Cook for about 2-3 minutes until it has thickened and reduced. When you start seeing the bottom of the pan while stirring, and the lines stay visible for a few seconds, you know the sauce is done. Transfer the sauce to a shallow heat-proof bowl and let cool uncovered for 30 minutes. Then cover and chill in the fridge for 1-2 hours or overnight. It thickens as it cools.</li>
            <li>To prepare the crust, line the bottom and the sides of a 9-inch (23cm) springform pan with parchment paper and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter and stir until the crumbs are evenly moist. Then, transfer the crumbs to the prepared pan and press the crust into the bottom and halfway up the sides, using the base of a flat-bottomed cup. Freeze the crust until you are done with the filling.
            </li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the whipping cream and 2 tablespoon of sugar on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer it to the fridge until you are done with the next step.</li>
            <li>In another large mixing bowl, mix the cream cheese, ½ cup sugar, and vanilla on medium-high speed until creamy, combined, and no lumps remain about 2 minutes. Add the chilled blueberry sauce (must be cold and as firm as jelly) and fold it into the cream cheese mixture until well combined.</li>
            <li>Gently fold one-third of the whipped cream into the blueberry mixture. Proceed with the remaining two-thirds of the whipped cream. Be careful that you don't overwork the filling. It's perfectly fine to have a few streaks of whipping cream throughout the filling. Better fold less than more. Transfer the filling to the prepared crust and spread evenly but carefully without deflating the filling. Chill in the fridge overnight. Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 1 month.</li>
