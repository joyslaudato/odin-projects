                <ul>
                    <li>24 oz cream cheese, softened</li>
                    <li>1 ½ cups granulated white sugar</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>12 oz semi-sweet chocolate bars, melted and cooled</li>
                    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a 9" (23cm) springform pan with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Crust</strong>: In a large bowl, stir together Oreo crumbs, melted butter, and cocoa until well combined and evenly moist. Transfer to the prepared pan and use the bottom of a flat-bottomed cup to press the crumbs into the bottom and halfway up the sides of the pan. Freeze until the filling is prepared.</li>
            <li><strong>Filling</strong>: In a large mixing bowl, using an electric mixer fitted with the whisk or paddle attachment, beat cream cheese until creamy, about 1 minute. Add sugar and cocoa and mix until smooth, about 1 minute. Mix in the vanilla and melted chocolate just to combine. Add heavy whipping cream and mix until soft peaks form, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spoon filling into the crust and spread evenly. Chill in the fridge for 4 hours or until firm. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.</li>
        </ol>
