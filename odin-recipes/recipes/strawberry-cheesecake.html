                    <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend strawberries with a hand blender until smooth. Place a medium saucepan over medium-high heat and set a fine mesh strainer on top. Pour strawberries through the strainer into the saucepan. Press fruit and liquid through the strainer and discard solids. Bring to a boil for about 5-10 minutes until it is reduced by half. Transfer to a bowl and let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir together graham cracker crumbs and melted butter just until combined. Transfer to a parchment paper layered 9" (23cm) round springform pan. Evenly press crumbs into the bottom and halfway up the sides of the pan with the back of a measuring cup. Freeze for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the filling. In a large mixing bowl mix with a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment cream cheese on medium speed until creamy for about 1 minute. Add reduced strawberries, sugar, and vanilla and mix until smooth. Add heavy whipping cream and mix until soft peaks form for about 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour filling into crust and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight until the filling is firm. Serve with whipped cream and strawberries on top if desired. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge up to 3 days.</li>
        </ol>
